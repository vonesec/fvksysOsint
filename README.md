Welcome to the ultimate stash of free OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools – your secret weapon for digital reconnaissance. This repo is all about gathering intel from the wilds of the open web, using nothing but the power of publicly available data. Whether you're tracking down a digital footprint, analyzing social media chatter, uncovering hidden domain info, or hunting through geospatial data, these tools will give you the edge.

We’re not talking about overpriced, commercial software here. These are the real, open-source gems that can help you infiltrate the depths of the internet and uncover the truth – no one’s watching. Perfect for researchers, hackers, threat hunters, or anyone who needs to peel back the layers of digital obscurity.

Brought to you by FVKsys, a group of like-minded hackers who believe in the power of knowledge and transparency. We don’t play by the rules – we make our own. The only limit is your creativity.

Plug in, gear up, and start your investigation.
